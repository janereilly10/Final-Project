# Final-Project Final Report
## Introduction 
For our project, we analyzed three different factors in order to conclude what the best neighborhood is in Pittsburgh.  Initially, our approach was to analyze the neighborhoods based off of the income of its residents and its crime rates.  After looking into different data bases, none of the income data sufficiently matched what we were looking for so we decided to analyze the amount of trash (in tons) that is dumped in each neighborhood as well as its crime rates.

## The Metric
As mentioned above, our metric to measure "bestness" of the Pittsburgh Neighborhoods is the number (in tons) of trash at illegal dump sites, the number of non-traffic police citations, and crime incident data from the Police Incident Blotter.  Our ideal neighborhood would have the least amount of trash and police citations.  The links to the data sets are found below.

## The Best Neighborhood
After analyzing the different datasets, we have determined that Hays is the best neighborhood in Pittsburgh.  In our datasets, Hays ranked as having one of the lowest amounts of illegal trash dumped (1.3 tons) and lowest amount of police citations and crimes.  From further research, Hays is a neighborhood in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania with a population of 3,025. Hays is mostly residential and has very highly rated public schools.  There are also a lot of bars and parks for its residents.

## Jane's Conclusion
I was surprised to see that Hays was the "best" neighborhood from our metric system.  I am from Pittsburgh and had never heard of this area so I was expecting it to be Shadyside or Squirrel Hill.  After researching Hays
